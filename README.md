_LEO, an embodied multi-modal generalist agent capable of grounding, reasoning, chatting, planning, and acting in the 3D world. LEO is trained in a two-stage scheme: (i) 3D vision-language (VL) alignment and (ii) 3D vision-language-action (VLA) instruction tuning._

## Intro
Some researchers believe that the current work in AI will eventually result in the creation of a single generalist model that is able to handle any problem that comes its way. In this blog, we will discuss the ideas, experiments, and results that came of the creation of LEO, an embodied multimodal generalist agent that represents one more step towards that amazingly well-rounded generalist model.

## Experiments and Results
 - The instruction tuning of LEO conforms to the scaling law
 - Scaling up LLM
 - Alignment leads to consistent improvements.
